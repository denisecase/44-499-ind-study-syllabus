        Students are expected to meet with the professor and demonstrate
        progress approximately once per week. It is the responsibility of the
        student to promptly notify his or her instructor when unable to attend
        meetings or events.

        <h2>Email Requirements</h2>

        <p>Professional email practices are required.</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="highlight ">
            Email must include course number and section (e.g.,
            <strong>44-499-03</strong>) in the subject line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Email should be professional, politely written, and use proper
            grammar, capitalization, and spelling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Citation Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
          <li class="highlight ">
            <strong>Cite ALL Sources</strong>. You must provide proper citation
            for any content including text, images, videos, and code
            <strong>that you did not personally develop</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Do not copy and paste content for any submissions.</li>
          <li>
            Failing to acknowledge assistance including internet photos,
            clipart, slide content, course files, shared solutions, etc. can be
            expected to result in a 0 on the assignment, a one-half letter grade
            reduction, a 0 in the course, and/or a failing the course with an
            academic integrity violation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Late Work Policy</h2>

        <p>
          Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. If you
          must miss a meeting or a due date, contact the instructor in advance
          or as early as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          On rare occassions, special challenges or obligations may make it
          difficult to submit on time. You typically have a one-week grace
          period where the work may still be submitted and graded. Late
          penalties will be desribed in the rubric. No late submissions will be
          accepted for the final submission.
        </p>

        <h2>Submissions</h2>

        All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. You may be
        asked to explain your work during class, in discussions, or in a
        recorded submission.

        <h2>Grading</h2>

        Grades will generally be posted within 2-7 days of the due date. If you
        wish to petition for additional points, please wait 24 hours. Petitions
        must be emailed, and must include the specific changes you are
        requesting, along with your reasoning on why the higher score is
        warranted. Challenges must be raised within seven days of the grade
        being posted; after seven days, grades are considered final.

        you may need to submit this to a potential employer or another
        university in the future. We do not provide materials after completion
        of the course.
